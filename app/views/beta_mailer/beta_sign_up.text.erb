We think it goes without saying, you have great taste. 

We're excited to share Hummingbird with you so that discovering and keeping track of your favorite anime is easier than ever. That level of awesome doesn't come without a price, that price is time and a lot of hardwork. So, while we're not quite ready yet, we are in the process of opening the doors to our beta users and you're one of them! Congrats! :) 

With the way our recommendation algorithm works, the more users we have the more accurate our engine becomes. We may even have something special in store for users who go above and beyond to get the Hummingbird name out there. Just don't spam. Spamming is never cool. 

In the meantime, if you have questions, suggestions or you'd just like to say 'hello', don't be shy! We're a friendly bunch. 

See you soon! 
The Hummingbird Team
