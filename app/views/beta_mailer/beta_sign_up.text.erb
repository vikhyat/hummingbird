We think it goes without saying, you have great taste.

We're excited to share Hummingbird with you so that discovering and keeping tracking of your favorite anime is easier than ever. That level of awesome doesn't come without a price, and in this case, that price is a significant time investment and a lot of hard work. 

We're almost finished and have started sending beta invites out to users in the order they were requested. Keep an eye on our Facebook and twitter accounts, we sometimes give out early access, just to keep things interesting!
