We think it goes without saying, you have great taste.

We're excited to share Hummingbird with you so that discovering and keeping track of your favorite anime is easier than ever. That level of awesome doesn't come without a price, and in this case, that price is a significant time investment and a lot of hard work. 

The good news is, we're just about finished and sending invites out on a daily basis in the order they're received. There are, however, a few promo codes floating around. In that event that you have an early access promo code you can redeem it by entering your email again and clicking the link that says 'have an invite code?' 

Also be sure to keep an eye on our Facebook and twitter accounts, we sometimes give out early access, just to keep things interesting!
